# Memory Matching Game

## Overview

Once the project is complete in the coming weeks it will be a simple memory-matching game where you have to match pairs of images. The game starts with 12 cards laid out face down, and you need to pick two cards at a time. If the two cards match, they remain visible; otherwise, they turn face down again. The goal is to match all the pairs with the fewest number of attempts.

## Assignment Breakdown

This week, the goal was to focus on creating two arrays: one for the blank images and another for the actual images. The images are randomized, and the game board is displayed as a 3x4 grid (12 total cells). The user can click on the blank images to reveal the corresponding image. 

### Key Requirements Implemented:
1. **Array of Blank Images**: A blank image is shown initially for all 12 cards.( I used a single image of a playing card for this)
2. **Array of Actual Images**: Randomly chosen images from a pool of 10 images.
3. **Randomization of Images**: The images are shuffled before being displayed on the grid.
4. **Click Event Handling**: The user clicks on two blank cards to reveal their images, and the game checks if they match.
5. **Grid Display**: The game board is a 3x4 grid with each image taking up equal space.

## Files Overview

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the game structure and logic.
- **style.css**: Stylesheet that defines the layout and image sizing.
- **images/**: Folder containing the blank image and the 10 images used for the game.

## Reflection

This week, I focused on setting up the basic structure for the memory-matching game. I implemented two arrays: one for blank images and another for the actual images that will be randomized. The images are shuffled using JavaScript's random functions, and the grid layout was achieved using simple CSS. 



For next week, I plan to expand the game by implementing a summary page to display the number of attempts after completing the game. As well as get more creative with the css and visual appeal of the game. 

## Chatgpt

This week while using chat gpt I just copy and pasted the assignment guidelines straight off canvas and enter it into chatgpt.  It worked reasonably well but did not update images becuase there was no image file that matched.  But everything else seem to work well.  It actually went with the full assignment and had coding for the whole thing not just this weeks assignment.  I modified the outputted  code to use the image files I had used with and it worked fairly flawlessly after that.  Again it did lack alot of visual appeal and didnt have any creative or appealing look with me keeping my stylesheet pretty simple this week do to a shorter assignment and follow on weeks to work on it.

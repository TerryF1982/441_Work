# Interactive Canvas Game

## Description
This project is an interactive canvas-based game where:
- A player-controlled object moves using arrow keys.
- An autonomous object moves on its own.
- If they collide, the background color changes, and the objects grow in size.
- Objects are restricted to the canvas edges.
- Background music plays automatically.

## Files
- `index.html` â€“ Main webpage containing the canvas and background music.
- `style.css` â€“ Styles for the canvas and webpage layout.
- `script.js` â€“ JavaScript logic for movement, collision detection, and interaction.
- `music/bg-music.mp3` â€“ Background music file.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use arrow keys to move the blue player object.
3. Watch the red object move autonomously.
4. Observe changes when they collide!

## Future Enhancements
- Add more objects with different behaviors.
- Include scoring and game mechanics.
- Improve visuals and animations.

Enjoy the game! ðŸŽ®

## Website Creation Reflection

I used ChatGPT to assist with creating the website. While it provided a decent arrangement of the content, I found its responses to be too generic for my preferences. I made changes to better align the content with my vision.

### My Perspective on AI in Web Development

- **Strengths of AI:**
  - ChatGPT helped organize the website layout efficiently.
  - It was useful for setting up foundational elements like linking files and styling basics.

- **Limitations of AI:**
  - I prefer not to have AI describe personal aspects about me.
  - Content creation feels personal and authentic only when I am the one generating it.

### Conclusion
AI tools like ChatGPT can be a helpful starting point for building a websiteâ€™s structure. However, to truly call the site my own, I feel the content must be written by me.

# Path to Valhalla Game

## Overview

This is a simple text-based adventure game where you play as Ragnar, a Viking King, making decisions that lead to different outcomes. .


## Challenges

- **Managing Story Paths:** The game has multiple branching choices. Keeping track of the current state and making sure the correct content loads was a bit tricky.  I did end up testing and retesting each path several times before I was able to make it do what I wanted. 


## Solutions

- I used JavaScript functions to separate different paths in the story, which helped manage the flow of the game.
- I made sure each choice updated the page by manipulating the DOM, allowing for smooth transitions between scenes.


## AI and Chat GPT

I tried just inputting the assignment guidelines into chatgpt.  While the outcome was workable, there really wasnt any visual appeal to it.  I did rely on chatgpt to help me find and correct errors as well as finding structural issues when I ran into roadblocks.  I maintain the idea that AI is a great and useful to tool for assistance but still cannot fully output usable results.
